## Detailed Methodology Breakdown

### Philosophy and Approach

#### Jack Daniels: Scientific Precision
- **Foundation**: VDOT system for precise training zone calculation
- **Philosophy**: "Quality over quantity" with measurable progress
- **Approach**: Data-driven training with exact pace prescriptions
- **Best Quote**: "Run all easy runs easy and all hard runs hard"

```typescript
// Daniels approach: Precise, measurable, scientific
const danielsPhilosophy = {
  dataFocus: 'High',
  paceSpecificity: 'Exact', 
  individualCustomization: 'VDOT-based',
  progressMeasurement: 'Quantitative performance metrics'
};
```

#### Arthur Lydiard: Aerobic Foundation
- **Foundation**: Massive aerobic base before any anaerobic work
- **Philosophy**: "Train to train" - build capacity first, speed later
- **Approach**: Time and effort-based with strict periodization
- **Best Quote**: "It's the miles you put in during base training that determine your success"

```typescript
// Lydiard approach: Patient, systematic, foundation-focused
const lydiardPhilosophy = {
  patience: 'Essential',
  baseEmphasis: 'Extreme',
  periodization: 'Strict phase separation',
  effortFocus: 'Conversational running priority'
};
```

#### Pete Pfitzinger: Systematic Development
- **Foundation**: Lactate threshold as the key physiological marker
- **Philosophy**: Systematic progression with race-specific preparation
- **Approach**: Structured volume with consistent quality integration
- **Best Quote**: "The lactate threshold is the most important physiological variable for marathon performance"

```typescript
// Pfitzinger approach: Systematic, LT-focused, marathon-specific
const pfitzingerPhilosophy = {
  structuredProgression: 'Methodical',
  lactateThreshold: 'Central focus',

## Periodization Approaches

### Training Phase Emphasis

#### Daniels Periodization
- **Base Phase**: Establish aerobic foundation, introduce quality
- **Build Phase**: Increase quality volume, maintain aerobic base
- **Peak Phase**: Race-specific work, reduce volume
- **Taper**: Maintain sharpness, reduce fatigue

#### Lydiard Periodization  
- **Base Phase** (12-16 weeks): Pure aerobic development
- **Anaerobic Phase** (4-6 weeks): Lactate tolerance work
- **Coordination Phase** (2-4 weeks): Speed and race preparation
- **Competition**: Peak fitness for racing

#### Pfitzinger Periodization
- **Base Building**: Establish volume with some LT work
- **Build Up**: Increase LT volume and marathon specificity  
- **Peak**: Maximum training stress with race preparation
- **Taper**: Systematic reduction while maintaining fitness

### Phase Duration Comparison

```typescript
const phaseDurations = {
  daniels: {
    base: '4-8 weeks (flexible)',
    build: '6-10 weeks',
    peak: '2-4 weeks',
    taper: '1-2 weeks',
    totalPlan: '12-24 weeks'
  },
  
  lydiard: {

| **Lydiard** | Steady State | 30-60 min @ steady effort | Aerobic power development |
| **Pfitzinger** | LT Tempo | 20-40 min @ LT pace | Lactate threshold adaptation |

### Long Run Philosophy
