# Linting and Formatting Decisions

## ESLint Disable Directives

### Issue: Console Usage in Error Handling

**Location:** `src/types/error-types.ts`
- Line 461: `console.error('Type validation error:', {`
- Line 482: `console.error('Schema validation error:', {`

**Rule Disabled:** `no-console`

**Rationale:**
1. **Error Logging Necessity**: These console.error statements are in error handling utility functions that provide detailed debugging information for type validation failures
2. **Development vs Production**: These logs are crucial for debugging type validation issues during development and can be conditionally enabled/disabled in production builds
3. **No Alternative Available**: The error handlers need to output diagnostic information, and console.error is the appropriate mechanism for error logging in this context
4. **Limited Scope**: The disable directive is applied only to specific lines where console usage is intentional and necessary

**Alternative Considered:**
- Using a proper logging library (Winston, Pino) - rejected due to added dependency overhead for what is primarily a type utility library
- Removing console statements entirely - rejected as it would eliminate valuable debugging information

**Decision:** Keep console.error statements with explicit ESLint disable directives to maintain debugging capabilities while acknowledging the rule violation.

**Future Action:** Consider implementing a configurable logging strategy if this library grows to include more extensive logging needs.

## Prettier Formatting Decisions

**Date:** 2025-08-02 14:36  
**Files Processed:** 75 TypeScript files across src/ directory  
**Configuration:** Default Prettier settings (no custom .prettierrc found)

### Key Formatting Changes Applied:

1. **String Quotes**: Standardized to double quotes (`"`) across all files
2. **Semicolons**: Added trailing semicolons where missing
3. **Line Endings**: Standardized to LF (Unix-style) line endings
4. **Indentation**: Applied 2-space indentation consistently
5. **Trailing Commas**: Added trailing commas in objects and arrays where beneficial
6. **Line Width**: Applied default 80-character line width with intelligent wrapping
7. **Object Formatting**: Improved object literal formatting and property alignment

### Rationale for Default Configuration:
- **Consistency**: Default Prettier settings provide industry-standard formatting
- **Team Collaboration**: Standard configuration reduces bike-shedding and merge conflicts  
- **Tool Integration**: Default settings work seamlessly with most editors and CI/CD pipelines
- **Maintainability**: Consistent formatting improves code readability and reduces cognitive load

### Files with Significant Changes:
- Type definition files in `src/types/`: Improved interface and type formatting
- Test files: Standardized test structure and assertion formatting
- Core modules: Enhanced readability through consistent indentation and spacing

**Decision**: Applied default Prettier configuration to maintain consistency with TypeScript community standards and improve overall code quality and readability.
